This Tic Tac Toe game is initialized with a 2d Array made of 3 empty arrays, each with 3 empty values. Despite each value having two index numbers, the user can enter a number between 1 and 9, which will
place a marker at the desired location. The game also has a computer and user classes allowing the game to be played with different combinations of human and automated player. The game can be played with 
two humans, two computers, or 1 human and 1 compputer. The computer class currently get a random number between 1 and 9, so it's extremely easy to beat; however, future updates will add a slightly more 
complex AI to the computer object.
